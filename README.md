# CryptoBot
A new version of my old crypto bot. Only testing purposes at the moment but will be able to trade real soon.

main.py - the main file for the crypto bot, where it makes descisions and trades
menu.py - graphics of the menu, when proper menu settings are made. This wil be removed when a GUI is created
config.js - settings for the bot
